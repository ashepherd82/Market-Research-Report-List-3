<p><strong>The Scuba Regulators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>First Stage Scuba Regulator</li><li>Second Stage Scuba Regulator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Scuba regulators consist of two main types: First Stage Scuba Regulator and Second Stage Scuba Regulator. The First Stage Regulator reduces the high-pressure air in the tank to an intermediate pressure and delivers it to the Second Stage Regulator. The Second Stage Regulator then further decreases the pressure to a breathable level and allows divers to breathe comfortably underwater. Both regulators are essential components in a scuba diving setup and ensure a safe and enjoyable diving experience.</p></p>
