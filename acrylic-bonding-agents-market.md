<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Acrylic Bonding Agents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Re-Emulsifiable</li><li>Not Re-Emulsifiable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Acrylic bonding agents are available in two main types: re-emulsifiable and not re-emulsifiable. Re-emulsifiable bonding agents can be re-dissolved in water after drying, making them suitable for surfaces that may need to be reworked or repaired. On the other hand, not re-emulsifiable bonding agents form a permanent bond and cannot be re-dissolved in water once they have dried. These types offer different benefits depending on the intended application, providing users with choices based on their specific needs.</p></p>
