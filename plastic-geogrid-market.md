<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Plastic Geogrid Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Uniaxial Stretch Plastic Geogrid</li><li>Two-Way Stretch Plastic Geogrid</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Plastic geogrids are categorized into two main types: uniaxial stretch and two-way stretch. Uniaxial stretch geogrids are designed to primarily withstand forces in one direction, offering superior strength in that particular axis. On the other hand, two-way stretch geogrids can withstand forces in both directions, providing a more versatile solution for supporting soil and stabilizing structures. Both types of plastic geogrids are commonly used in various civil engineering and construction projects to improve the overall stability and performance of the soil.</p></p>
