<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Web Tension Control Syetem Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open Loop System</li><li>Closed Loop System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Web tension control systems are essential in industries where materials like paper, plastic, or metal need to be processed. There are two main types of systems - open loop and closed loop. In an open loop system, tension is controlled based on predetermined parameters without feedback. On the other hand, a closed loop system constantly monitors tension and adjusts it in real-time using feedback data. Closed loop systems are more precise and accurate, making them preferred for high-quality production processes.</p></p>
