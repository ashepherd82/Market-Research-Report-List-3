<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dual Cure Adhesives Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Acrylate Mixture Based</li><li>Epoxy Resins Based</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Dual cure adhesives are classified into two main types - acrylate mixture based and epoxy resins based. Acrylate mixture based adhesives typically contain a combination of acrylate monomers and photoinitiators which cure upon exposure to UV light and activators which cure in the absence of light. On the other hand, epoxy resins based adhesives cure through a chemical reaction between epoxy resin and hardener. Both types of adhesives offer unique benefits and are used in a variety of industries for bonding applications.</p></p>
