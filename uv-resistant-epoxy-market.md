<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The UV Resistant Epoxy Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Solvent Based</li><li>Water Based</li></ul></p>
<p><p>UV Resistant Epoxy Market is divided into two types based on composition - Solvent Based and Water Based. Solvent Based UV resistant epoxy uses chemicals as carriers for the epoxy resins, resulting in a more durable and longer lasting finish. On the other hand, Water Based UV resistant epoxy uses water as a carrier, making it a more environmentally friendly option. Both types offer protection against UV radiation, but water-based epoxy is preferred for its eco-friendly properties.</p></p>
