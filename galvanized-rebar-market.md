<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Galvanized Rebar Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Conventional Hot-dip Salvanized Rebar</li><li>Continuous Hot-dip Galvanized Rebar</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Galvanized rebar is available in two main types: Conventional Hot-dip Galvanized Rebar and Continuous Hot-dip Galvanized Rebar. Conventional hot-dip galvanized rebar is coated through a batch process, resulting in a thick layer of zinc. Continuous hot-dip galvanized rebar is coated using a inline process, resulting in a thinner and more consistent zinc coating. Both types of galvanized rebar provide corrosion protection, but continuous hot-dip galvanized rebar is typically more uniform and cost-effective for large-scale projects.</p></p>
