<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aircraft Pushback Tugs Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Conventional/Towbars Pushback Tugs</li><li>Towbarless Pushback Tugs</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Conventional/Towbars Pushback Tugs are equipped with a towbar that is attached to the aircraft for pushing it back from the gate. These tugs require the operator to hook up and disconnect the towbar manually. On the other hand, Towbarless Pushback Tugs do not require a towbar as they lift the aircraft's nose gear directly, making them quicker and more maneuverable. Towbarless tugs are also able to push back larger aircraft more efficiently. Both types of tugs serve the same purpose of moving aircraft on the ground.</p></p>
