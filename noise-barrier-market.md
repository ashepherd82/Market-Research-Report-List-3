<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Noise Barrier Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ground-Mounted Noise Barrier</li><li>Structure-Mounted Noise Barrier</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Ground-Mounted Noise Barrier refers to barriers that are installed on the ground level to block and absorb sound waves coming from transportation or industrial activities. These barriers are typically made of materials such as concrete, metal, or earth berms. On the other hand, Structure-Mounted Noise Barrier involves attaching noise barriers directly onto existing structures such as buildings or walls to reduce noise pollution. Both types of noise barriers serve the same purpose of improving acoustic comfort for nearby residents and workers.</p></p>
