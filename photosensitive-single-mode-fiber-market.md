<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Photosensitive Single Mode Fiber Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cladding Photosensitive Single Mode Fiber</li><li>Unclad Photosensitive Single Mode Fiber</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Photosensitive Single Mode Fiber is categorized into two main types: Cladding Photosensitive Single Mode Fiber and Unclad Photosensitive Single Mode Fiber. Cladding Photosensitive Fiber has a protective outer layer called a cladding, which helps in guiding light along the fiber core. On the other hand, Unclad Photosensitive Fiber does not have this outer layer, making it more flexible and sensitive to changes in surrounding conditions. Both types have their own unique applications in industries such as telecommunications, sensing, and medical devices.</p></p>
