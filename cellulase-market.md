<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cellulase Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>EG</li><li>CBH</li><li>BG</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cellulase is an enzyme that works to break down cellulose, a complex sugar found in plant cell walls. There are three main types of cellulase enzymes - Endoglucanase (EG), Cellobiohydrolase (CBH), and Beta-glucosidase (BG). EG enzymes attack cellulose chains at random points, CBH enzymes break down cellulose from the ends to release cellobiose, and BG enzymes further break down cellobiose into glucose. These different types of enzymes work together in the cellulase market to efficiently convert cellulose into usable sugars for various industrial applications.</p></p>
