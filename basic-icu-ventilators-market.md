<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Basic ICU Ventilators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive Ventilation</li><li>Non-invasive Ventilation</li></ul></p>
<p><p>ICU ventilators are medical devices that assist patients in breathing. There are two main types of ICU ventilators - invasive ventilation and non-invasive ventilation. Invasive ventilation involves inserting a tube into the patient's airway to deliver oxygen and remove carbon dioxide. It is typically used for patients who cannot breathe on their own. On the other hand, non-invasive ventilation provides respiratory support through a mask or nasal prongs, avoiding the need for intubation. It is often used for patients with less severe respiratory issues or those who require short-term assistance.</p></p>
