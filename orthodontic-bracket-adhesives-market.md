<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Orthodontic Bracket Adhesives Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Light-Curable</li><li>Chemical-Curable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Orthodontic bracket adhesives refer to the substances used to attach brackets to teeth during orthodontic treatment. Light-curable bracket adhesives are those that harden when exposed to a specific light wavelength, while chemical-curable bracket adhesives harden through a chemical reaction. Light-curable adhesives offer the advantage of quick and easy application, as they only require a short period of light exposure. Chemical-curable adhesives, on the other hand, may require longer curing times but offer better results in terms of bond strength and stability.</p></p>
