<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Laboratory Grown Diamond Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>CVD Diamonds</li><li>HTHP Diamonds</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Laboratory grown diamond market consists of two main types: CVD diamonds and HTHP diamonds. CVD diamonds are produced through a chemical vapor deposition process, where a diamond seed crystal is exposed to a gas mixture to grow a diamond layer. On the other hand, HTHP diamonds are created through high pressure, high temperature conditions that mimic the natural diamond formation process. Both types of laboratory grown diamonds offer a sustainable and ethical alternative to mined diamonds, catering to consumers' increasing demand for eco-friendly and conflict-free jewelry options.</p></p>
